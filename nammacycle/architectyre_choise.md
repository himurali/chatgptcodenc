The performance comparison between Haskell and Spring MVC (part of the Spring Framework in Java) can be nuanced and depends on various factors such as the nature of the application, the specific use cases, and how the code is written and optimized. Here's a general comparison:

Haskell
Performance:

Haskell is known for its high performance due to its strong static typing, lazy evaluation, and efficient concurrency model. Programs written in Haskell can be very efficient, especially for computation-heavy tasks.
The Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC) produces highly optimized code, and Haskell's immutability can lead to fewer bugs and better performance in concurrent applications.
Concurrency:

Haskell has excellent support for concurrency and parallelism. The lightweight threads (green threads) and STM (Software Transactional Memory) provide a robust framework for building concurrent applications.
Use Cases:

Haskell is often used in scenarios where performance and correctness are critical, such as in financial systems, high-frequency trading platforms, and complex algorithms.
Spring MVC (Java)
Performance:

Spring MVC can also offer high performance, particularly for web applications. The performance largely depends on the JVM and how well the code and application are optimized.
The Java ecosystem has a rich set of libraries and tools for performance tuning and monitoring, which can help in optimizing a Spring MVC application.
Concurrency:

Java and the Spring Framework have robust support for concurrency. Java's threading model and the extensive concurrency utilities provided by the standard library can handle a wide range of concurrent applications effectively.
Use Cases:

Spring MVC is widely used for building scalable web applications. Its strong ecosystem and support for enterprise applications make it a popular choice for large-scale web services, APIs, and business applications.
Comparison
Raw Performance: Haskell might have an edge in raw computational performance, especially for algorithm-heavy tasks due to its highly optimized compiler and language features.
Web Applications: Spring MVC is often faster and more practical for building web applications due to its mature ecosystem, extensive libraries, and tools that facilitate development and deployment.
Concurrency: Haskell's lightweight concurrency model may offer better performance in highly concurrent scenarios, while Java's threading and concurrency utilities provide a robust alternative.
Conclusion
The choice between Haskell and Spring MVC should be based on the specific requirements of the project. If the project demands high-performance computations and robust concurrency, Haskell might be a better fit. For building scalable web applications with a rich set of tools and libraries, Spring MVC would likely be more practical and efficient.

For a bicycle-sharing project with functionalities like renting and booking bicycles, where the app will have a mobile-based front end using React Native, here are some considerations for choosing between Haskell and Spring MVC for the backend:

Spring MVC (Java)
Ecosystem and Libraries:

Rich Ecosystem: Spring MVC, as part of the Spring Framework, has a rich ecosystem with extensive libraries and tools that can accelerate development.
Integration: Excellent integration with various databases, caching solutions, security frameworks, and third-party services.
RESTful Services: Spring MVC is well-suited for building RESTful APIs, which are typically used by mobile applications to communicate with the backend.
Scalability and Performance:

Enterprise-Grade: Spring MVC is designed for enterprise applications and can handle large-scale deployments efficiently.
Optimizations: With Java's performance tuning tools and JVM optimizations, Spring MVC can offer high performance and scalability.
Developer Community and Support:

Community: Large and active developer community with extensive documentation and support.
Framework Maturity: Mature framework with proven stability and reliability for production systems.
Concurrency and Transactions:

Concurrency Handling: Java provides robust concurrency utilities, and Spring MVC supports complex transaction management, which is crucial for managing bookings and rentals in real-time.
Haskell
Performance:

Efficiency: Haskell's strong typing, immutability, and lazy evaluation can lead to highly efficient and performant applications.
Concurrency: Haskell's concurrency model (lightweight threads and STM) can be advantageous for managing concurrent operations like multiple bookings and rentals.
Correctness and Reliability:

Strong Typing: Haskell's type system can catch many errors at compile time, leading to more reliable and maintainable code.
Immutability: Immutable data structures can reduce bugs and simplify reasoning about the system's state.
Learning Curve and Community:

Learning Curve: Haskell has a steeper learning curve compared to Java and Spring MVC, which might impact development speed if the team is not already familiar with it.
Smaller Community: While Haskell has a dedicated community, it is smaller compared to the Java/Spring ecosystem, potentially limiting resources and support.
Recommendation
Given the nature of your project—a bicycle-sharing application with mobile front end and functionalities like renting and booking bicycles—the Spring MVC framework is likely the more practical and efficient choice for the following reasons:

Ecosystem and Tools: The rich ecosystem and mature tools of Spring MVC can significantly speed up development and deployment.
Integration: Better integration with databases, third-party services, and tools that are commonly used in mobile and web applications.
Scalability: Proven scalability and performance in handling enterprise-grade applications, which is crucial for a bicycle-sharing system expected to handle a large number of users and transactions.
Developer Familiarity: Java and Spring MVC are widely used and familiar to many developers, which can reduce the learning curve and increase development speed.
Conclusion
While Haskell offers high performance and correctness, the practical advantages of Spring MVC, such as ecosystem support, scalability, and developer familiarity, make it a better fit for your bicycle-sharing project. This choice will help ensure a smoother development process and robust backend support for your mobile app.
